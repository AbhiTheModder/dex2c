<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a forked version of [amimo/dcc](https://github.com/amimo/dcc), which aims to make it easy for everyone to use this tool. We automated plenty of process that you had to do manually in original dcc. Moreover, we always try to add new features to make this tool more usable in real world applications.


### Built With

* ![Python][Python3]
* [![Androguard][Androguard3]][Androguard_Url]


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation

It requires python 3.8 or higher version to run this tool. So, make sure your python is up-to-date.

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ratsan/dex2c.git
   ```
2. Open cloned directory
   ```bash
   cd dex2c
   ```
3. Download apktool latest version from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/) and save it in `tools` folder with name `apktool.jar`
   ```bash
   wget -O tools/apktool.jar https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/apktool_2.7.0.jar
   ```
4. <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads">Download</a> andorid ndk for your operating system and extract it. Copy the folder path where `ndk-build` executable is located inside the extracted folder and configure `ndk_dir` in `dcc.cfg`

### Linux

1. Install required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Install JRE or JDK if not already installed
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
   ```

### Windows

1. Install required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Install JRE or JDK from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html">oracle</a> if not already installed. Then add the bin folder path in PATH environment variable. Search in google, how to install jdk in windows if you need more guidance on this topic.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Filters

Add all your filters in `filter.txt` file - one rule each line. Filters are are made using regex patterns. There are two types of filters avilable in dcc - whitelist, blacklist. Use them according to your need.

#### WhiteList

- Protect just one method in a specific class. It's just a demo.
```
com/some/class;some_method(some_parameters)return_type
```

- Protect all methods in a specific class. It's also just a demo.
```
com/some/class;.*
```

- Protect all methods in all classes under a package path. It's also just a demo.
```
com/some/package/.*;.*
```

- Protect a method with the name onCreate in all classes. It's also just a demo.
```
.*;onCreate\(.*
```

##### BlackList

Adding an exclamation `!` sign before a rule will mark that rule as a blacklist.

- Exclude one method in a specific class from being protected. It's just a demo.
```
!com/some/class;some_method(some_parameters)return_type
```

- Exclude all methods in a specific class from being protected. It's also just a demo.
```
!com/some/class;.*
```

- Exclude all methods in all classes under a package path from being protected. It's also just a demo.
```
!com/some/package/.*;.*
```

- Exclude a method with the name onCreate in all classes from being protected. It's also just a demo.
```
!.*;onCreate\(.*
```

### Protect Apps

- Copy your apk file in `dex2c` folder where `dcc.py` is located and run this command

```bash
python3 dcc.py -a input.apk -o output.apk
```

- Run this command to know about all the other options available in dcc to find the best ones for your need

```bash
python3 dcc.py --help
```
