# Rules are made using regex patters
# In dcc smali is processed like this - com/package/some_class;some_method(parameters)return_type
# So your patterns should correspond to our smali processing style

# You can exclude a method in all classes from being protected using !
!<init>
!onCreate

# You can exclude a method in a specific class from being protected using !
# Here we are excluding onCreate method from being protected in com/package/you_class
!com/package/your_class;onCreate\(.*

# You can also exclude classes from being protected using !
!com/package/your_class;.*

# Let's say, you want all methods in a certain class to be protected
com/package/your_class;.*

# Also if you want all methods from all classes in a certain package path to be protected
com/your/package/.*;.*
